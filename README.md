<h2>Compiling</h2>

<br>

<strong>This plugin requires Java 8 to be functional</strong>
<br>
<br>
This plugin utilises <i>Apache Maven</i> as it's dependency manager.
<br> 
To compile, simply run <code>mvnw</code> in the command line (<code>./mvnw</code> on unix based systems). 
<br>
Alternatively, you may opt to compile by double-clicking the <code>mvnw.cmd</code>.
<br>
<br>
The build goals are by default set to <code>clean package</code>. 
<br>
Compiled jars can be found under the directory <code>target/</code>
<br> 
<br>
If you already have maven installed on your machine, you may substitute <code>mvnw</code> with <code>mvn</code>.
<br> 
Finally, the plugin is compiled against the latest release of Spigot <code>1.12</code>, 
<br>
but it should work from versions <code>1.8.8</code> through <code>1.15.2</code>
